In many ways Greencoin strives to be Bitcoin without the downfall of scalability. 

The concept behind Greencoin is to provide a peer-to-peer network based on a protocol to ensure the ethicacy of a currency.

However the revolution of Greencoin is to accommodate these things while providing fee free and instant transactions. 

The concept is that a simplistic and user friendly interaction is required from global adoption of a cryptocurrency.

In order to accomplish these things, some phase of testing will be required to formulate things like maximum new transaction allowance from locations 
based on the size of the ledger. 

Greencoin application v0.0 is set to be released by January 9th, 2022. The application will very much be a functional 
prototype to allow for stress and network speed testing. 

Future applications will seek to accomplish other goals such as an intuitive and stylish GUI, 
bug fixes and much more. Ideally the community will outpace our application design efforts and an open-source, community driven application will become standard. 

Greencoin protocol is precise in the message contents to promote backwards compatibility in application design.

Specifically regarding v0.0 - designed with wxWidgets, CryptoPPâ€™s ECDSA and asio. Greencoin v0.0 will be released open-source and compiled for Windows
with a Linux compile released a few days after.

Users with a limited understanding of these systems should only use the most prevalent Greencoin application for security. 


Regarding personal security and the storing of private data: Greencoin is similar to Bitcoin in the respect that in the end it comes down to the user to protect their own data.


Greencoin v0.0 will provide tools for users to generate private keys and save them or view them to be written down. Private keys are displayed as a 
hex of the private exponent and public keys are displayed as a hex of the public element in Greencoin v0.0
