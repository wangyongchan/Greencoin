The first Greencoin website is a TEMPORARY domain necessary to allocate the integer locations to a diverse user base. 

Enthusiastic users can claim the earliest transactions in the network. The integer locations should only be claimed by crypto-enthusiastic users 
as they are the most valuable and highest traffic locations. 

The first transactions will be initiated into the network on the release of Greencoin v0.0 After release of Greencoin v0.0 trading on this domain 
will cease and trading will take place exclusively on the application network.


At that point this domain will be changed then converted into the first public transaction repository. 

Users that wish to verify the ledger will be able to check the entire history of all transactions via public repositories like this. 

It is recommended that multiple public repositories be kept by different users.
